<!--
COMBINED ARTIFACT TEMPLATE

What this is:
  A single document containing all four AIDOS artifacts as sections:
  Problem, Solution, Tech Design, and Testing. This is for Feature-scale
  work where one document covers everything.

  The content is identical to the four standalone templates (problem.md,
  solution.md, tech-design.md, testing.md) — just in one file. If the
  work grows beyond Feature scale, extract sections into separate files.
  The content transfers directly; no restructuring needed.

How to use:
  1. Start with the Problem section. Get it to DRAFT or STABLE before
     going deep on Solution.
  2. Work forward through the stack. Each section builds on the one
     before it.
  3. When new information surfaces, flow it backward — a discovery in
     Tech Design might reshape the Solution or the Problem.
  4. Each section has its own status. They don't all advance together.

Rubric criteria:
  Each section is audited against its own Discipline Rubric AND the
  Core Rubric (C1–C13). See the standalone templates for the full
  criterion-to-section mapping.

  Problem section:  Core + Problem Rubric (P1–P10)
  Solution section: Core + Solution Rubric (S1–S9)
  Tech Design section: Core + Tech Design Rubric (A1–A10)
  Testing section:  Core + Testing Rubric (T1–T9)

Coherence checks:
  Solution is checked against Problem.
  Tech Design is checked against Solution.
  Testing is checked against Tech Design and Solution.

Scaling:
  Feature — the primary use case. One builder, one to two sprints.
  The Problem section can be lightweight if the Epic problem is strong.
  The Tech Design section carries the most weight — it's the brief
  for the coding agent.

  If a section needs more depth than this format allows, extract it
  into its own file using the corresponding standalone template.
