# AIDOS Confluence Connector

One-way publish of AIDOS artifacts from a `.aidos/` folder to Confluence.
The repository is source of truth. Confluence is a read-only projection.

## How It Works

The publish script recursively walks the `.aidos/` directory, converts each
markdown file to Confluence storage format (XHTML), and mirrors the folder
structure as a page hierarchy in Confluence.

- **Folders become pages** — subdirectories create parent pages with their
  contents as child pages
- **Status, Scale, Owner** are parsed from each file's metadata lines and
  rendered as a Confluence Page Properties table
- **Pages are matched by title** — no IDs stored in the manifest. Delete a
  page in Confluence, re-sync, it recreates cleanly.
- The **root page** gets a Page Properties Report macro that aggregates all
  descendant statuses into a dashboard table

### Folder conventions

| Scenario | What happens |
|----------|-------------|
| Folder has a `.md` file with the same name (`feature-auth/feature-auth.md`) | File content becomes the page body. Children macro appended to list child pages. |
| Folder has no matching `.md` file (`refs/`) | Auto-generated page with title + Children macro. All `.md` files inside become child pages. |
| Any depth of nesting | Fully recursive — nest as deep as you need. |

Page titles are derived from filenames: strip `.md`, split on `-`,
title-case each word. `tech-design.md` becomes **Tech Design**.

## Markdown → Confluence Translation

The connector translates standard markdown features into native Confluence
macros for a rich reading experience.

| Markdown | Confluence | Notes |
|----------|-----------|-------|
| `**Status:** Draft` | Status lozenge in Page Properties table | See colour mapping below |
| `**Scale:** Feature` | Row in Page Properties table | Also applied as a label |
| `**Owner:** Simon` | Row in Page Properties table | |
| `[Solution](solution.md)` | `ac:link` (page title link) | Cross-artifact links resolve by title. Path prefixes stripped — works across folders. |
| `` ```js ... ``` `` | `ac:structured-macro` code block | Syntax-highlighted with language parameter |
| `> **Note:** text` | Info panel (blue) | |
| `> **Warning:** text` | Warning panel (yellow) | |
| `> **Decision:** text` | Note panel (yellow) | |
| `> **Tip:** text` | Tip panel (green) | |
| `<details><summary>Title</summary>` | Expand/collapse macro | Collapsible sections |
| Tables, lists, headings, bold, italic | Standard HTML equivalents | Passed through cleanly |

### Status lozenge colours

| Status | Colour |
|--------|--------|
| Not Started | Grey |
| Draft | Yellow |
| In Progress | Blue |
| Review | Purple |
| Done | Green |
| Blocked | Red |

Status matching is case-insensitive. Unrecognised values default to Grey.

### Labels

Every published page gets labels automatically:

| Label | Source |
|-------|--------|
| Artifact type | Derived from filename: `problem`, `tech-design`, `testing`, etc. |
| Scale | Parsed from `**Scale:** Epic` → label `epic` |
| `aidos` | Always applied — identifies connector-managed pages |

Labels enable Confluence search, CQL filtering, and dashboard reports.

## Prerequisites

- **Confluence Cloud** (not Server/Data Center)
- A Confluence **API token** — generate at
  https://id.atlassian.com/manage-profile/security/api-tokens
- A **root page** in your Confluence space — create one manually, copy its
  page ID from the URL (the numeric ID in `…/pages/123456789/…`)

## Manifest

Place a `manifest.json` in your `.aidos/` folder:

```json
{
  "publish": {
    "confluence": {
      "baseUrl": "https://example.atlassian.net",
      "rootPageId": "123456789"
    }
  }
}
```

That's it. Two fields. The script discovers files automatically, parses
metadata from each file, and derives the Confluence space from the root page.

To add more targets later, add another key under `publish`:

```json
{
  "publish": {
    "confluence": { "baseUrl": "...", "rootPageId": "..." },
    "sharepoint": { "siteUrl": "..." }
  }
}
```

Each connector reads only its own key and ignores the rest.

Validate your manifest against `manifest.schema.json` in this directory.

## GitHub Actions Workflow

Add this workflow to your consuming repo:

```yaml
name: Publish AIDOS to Confluence
on:
  push:
    paths: ['.aidos/**']
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  publish:
    uses: shobman/aidos/.github/workflows/confluence-publish.yml@main
    with:
      manifest-path: .aidos/manifest.json
    secrets:
      confluence_email: ${{ secrets.CONFLUENCE_EMAIL }}
      confluence_token: ${{ secrets.CONFLUENCE_TOKEN }}
```

Then add `CONFLUENCE_EMAIL` and `CONFLUENCE_TOKEN` as repository secrets.

If your repo has multiple `.aidos/` folders, omit `manifest-path` and the
workflow will auto-discover all `manifest.json` files.

## Local Testing

Run the script with `--dry-run` to see the page hierarchy and converted
bodies without calling the Confluence API:

```bash
node src/connectors/confluence/publish.js .aidos/manifest.json --dry-run
```

No authentication is required for dry-run. Output shows:
- Page hierarchy with indentation matching Confluence nesting
- Properties and labels for each page
- Whether each folder page is sourced from a `.md` file or auto-generated
