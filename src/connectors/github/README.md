# AIDOS GitHub MCP Connector

A local MCP server that gives AI agents (Claude Desktop, Copilot) read/write access to `.aidos/` folders in GitHub repos.

Lets non-technical users author AIDOS artifacts via AI without ever touching Git. The server runs as a subprocess of your MCP client and exposes 5 tools that the AI uses to resolve repos, read artifacts, save changes, review diffs, and submit PRs.

---

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js 20+** — `node --version` to check
- **GitHub account** with access to the repos you'll work on
- **Claude Desktop** (or another MCP-compatible client)
- A **GitHub OAuth App** with Device Flow enabled (see Install Step 1)
- A local clone of the `aidos` repo

## Install

### Step 1 — Register a GitHub OAuth App (Device Flow)

You need a GitHub OAuth App with **Device Flow** enabled. This is a one-time setup. The OAuth App can be registered under your personal account or your organisation.

1. Go to **GitHub → Settings → Developer Settings → OAuth Apps → New OAuth App**
   (or for an org: **Org Settings → Developer Settings → OAuth Apps**)
2. Fill in the form:
   - **Application name:** `AIDOS GitHub MCP` (anything descriptive)
   - **Homepage URL:** `https://github.com/<your-org>/aidos` (or any URL)
   - **Authorization callback URL:** `https://localhost` (not used by device flow, but required by the form)
3. Click **Register application**
4. On the app page, **tick the "Enable Device Flow" checkbox** and save
5. Copy the **Client ID** (looks like `Iv23li...`). You do **not** need to generate a client secret — device flow doesn't use one.

Required scopes (granted at first auth, no setup needed): `repo`, `read:org`.

### Step 2 — Install the connector

```bash
cd <your-aidos-clone>/src/connectors/github
npm install
```

### Step 3 — Configure Claude Desktop

Find your `claude_desktop_config.json`:

| OS      | Path                                                                |
|---------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Windows | `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`                       |
| macOS   | `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`   |
| Linux   | `~/.config/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`                       |

Add the `aidos-github` server entry. Use the **absolute path** to `server.js` and your **Client ID** from Step 1:

**Windows example:**
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "aidos-github": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["C:\\code\\repos\\aidos\\src\\connectors\\github\\server.js"],
      "env": {
        "AIDOS_GITHUB_CLIENT_ID": "Iv23li...your-client-id..."
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**macOS / Linux example:**
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "aidos-github": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/Users/you/code/aidos/src/connectors/github/server.js"],
      "env": {
        "AIDOS_GITHUB_CLIENT_ID": "Iv23li...your-client-id..."
      }
    }
  }
}
```

If the file already has other MCP servers, add `aidos-github` alongside them inside the existing `mcpServers` object.

### Step 4 — Restart Claude Desktop and verify

1. Quit Claude Desktop completely and reopen it
2. Start a new chat
3. The 5 AIDOS tools should be available: `open_workspace`, `read_artifacts`, `save`, `diff`, `publish`
4. Ask Claude: *"Open the AIDOS workspace for `<your-org>/<your-repo>`"*
5. The first call triggers GitHub device flow:
   - Claude shows: *"Go to https://github.com/login/device and enter code XXXX-XXXX"*
   - Open the URL, enter the code, authorise the OAuth App
   - Token is cached at `~/.aidos/auth.json` for future sessions

The auth flow is two-phase: the first call initiates device flow and returns the code; after you authorise in the browser, ask the AI to open the workspace again and it will pick up the token. Subsequent sessions skip auth entirely and go straight to work. Tokens are auto-refreshed if revoked.

## Use

### Tools

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `open_workspace` | Resolve repo (fuzzy match supported), create/sync working branch, discover `.aidos/` folders, validate manifest, surface work-in-progress and last publish status |
| `read_artifacts` | Batch read all files from a `.aidos/` folder |
| `save` | Preview files to commit (default) or commit them (`confirm=true`) |
| `diff` | Show changes vs target branch |
| `publish` | Run pre-flight checks (branch exists, conflicts, reviewers) and preview; execute on `confirm=true` |

`save` and `publish` are two-phase: the first call returns a preview, the second call with `confirm=true` performs the action. This gives the AI a chance to show you the plan before changes hit the repo.

### Workflow

```
open_workspace("my-repo") → creates aidos/{you} branch, finds .aidos/ folders,
                            validates manifest, reports WIP if any
read_artifacts(...)       → loads all artifacts into AI context
[work with AI]
save(files, message)      → returns preview of files and commit message
save(..., confirm=true)   → atomic commit to working branch
diff()                    → review changes vs target branch
publish()                 → runs pre-flight, returns check report
publish(..., confirm=true) → create PR or merge per manifest.json write config
```

### Manifest configuration

Each `.aidos/` folder in a repo needs a `manifest.json`. Add a `write` section to control how the connector integrates changes:

```json
{
  "write": {
    "strategy": "pr",
    "target": "main",
    "reviewers": ["@product-team"]
  }
}
```

| Field | Default | Description |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| `strategy` | `"pr"` | `"pr"` for pull request, `"push"` for direct merge |
| `target` | repo default | Branch to PR against or merge into |
| `reviewers` | `[]` | GitHub users (`alice`) or teams (`@org/team-name`) for PR review |

### Branch model

Each user gets one `aidos/{github-username}` branch per repo. The branch is created from the repo's default branch and the connector only touches `.aidos/` paths, ensuring clean merges with the rest of the codebase. After PR merge or push-merge, the branch is deleted. The next session creates a fresh one.

**Recommended:** enable *"Automatically delete head branches"* in the target repo's GitHub settings so `aidos/*` branches are cleaned up automatically after a PR merge.

### Publish side-effect

If the repo's `.aidos/manifest.json` has a `publish.*` section (e.g. `publish.confluence`), a merge of the working branch into the target branch will trigger a publish via GitHub Actions. The builder skill warns about this before submit — you'll know before any side-effects happen.

## Develop

### Get the code

```bash
git clone https://github.com/shobman/aidos.git
cd aidos/src/connectors/github
npm install
```

### Run the test suite

```bash
npm test
```

80 tests across 15 suites. All tests are unit tests with mocked `fetch` — no GitHub API calls, no network, no auth required. Runs in under a second.

    ├── resolve-repo.test.js    ← Fuzzy repo resolution tests
    └── tools.test.js           ← Tool logic tests with mocked client
```

Each logic function is exported from `server.js` and unit-tested in isolation (see `resolveWorkspace`, `readArtifacts`, `saveArtifacts`, `diffBranch`, `submitChanges`). The MCP tool registrations wrap these functions thinly — test the logic, not the MCP protocol.

### Run the server manually

Useful for debugging MCP traffic or testing tool registration without Claude Desktop:

```bash
# Start server and send an initialize + tools/list request
AIDOS_GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=Iv23li_your_client_id \
  printf '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"initialize","params":{"protocolVersion":"2025-03-26","capabilities":{},"clientInfo":{"name":"test","version":"0.1"}}}\n{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":2,"method":"tools/list","params":{}}' | \
  node server.js
```

Tool responses appear on stdout as JSON-RPC. All logging goes to stderr so it doesn't pollute the protocol stream.

### Extending with a new tool

1. Write the logic as an exported function in `server.js` following the same pattern as the existing ones (takes `client` as first arg, returns plain data)
2. Register it with `server.registerTool(...)` using a zod input schema
3. Add unit tests in `test/tools.test.js` using `mockClient()`
4. Run `npm test` to verify

## Troubleshooting

The connector translates GitHub errors into actionable guidance — most common issues surface as readable text in the AI chat. If you see one of the messages below, here's what to do.

**"The AIDOS GitHub connector needs a GitHub OAuth App Client ID..."**
The `AIDOS_GITHUB_CLIENT_ID` env var isn't reaching the server. Check that the `env` block is inside the `aidos-github` server entry in `claude_desktop_config.json`, then fully quit and restart Claude Desktop (not just close the window). The message includes step-by-step setup instructions.

**"The GitHub OAuth App Client ID appears to be invalid (GitHub returned 404)..."**
Either the Client ID is wrong, Device Flow is not enabled on the OAuth App, or the app has been deleted. Go to the OAuth App settings page, verify the Client ID matches your Claude Desktop config, and tick the "Enable Device Flow" checkbox.

**"Authentication required. Go to https://github.com/login/device..."**
First-time auth — open the URL in a browser, enter the code, authorise the OAuth App. Then ask the AI to open the workspace again; it will pick up the token. No need to restart the server.

**"Still waiting for authorisation..."**
You asked the AI to open the workspace again before completing the browser authorisation. Finish the authorisation in the browser, then ask the AI to retry.

**Tools don't appear in Claude Desktop**
Check the Claude Desktop logs (Settings → Developer → Open Logs Folder) for `aidos-github` errors. Common causes: wrong path to `server.js`, `npm install` not run, invalid JSON in `claude_desktop_config.json`.

**"Your changes conflict with what's on main..."**
Someone changed `.aidos/` files on the target branch while your `aidos/{you}` branch had unmerged work. A developer needs to resolve this manually with `git checkout aidos/{you} && git merge main`. This shows up in the `publish` pre-flight report before any changes are attempted.

**Re-authenticate**
Normally not needed — a revoked or expired token triggers a fresh device flow automatically on the next call. If you want to force it, delete `~/.aidos/auth.json` and `~/.aidos/pending_auth.json`.
